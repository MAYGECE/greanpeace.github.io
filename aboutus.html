        <h1>A green and peaceful future is our quest</h1>
        <h2>Greenpeace exists because this fragile earth deserves a voice.</h2>

        <p>
          Some people look at a forest, and all they see is lumber. But there
          are millions more who see a home, a heritage, a future. Around the
          globe, we are standing up for our communities, and we are holding
          governments and corporations accountable.
        </p>

          The primary tactic of Greenpeace has been such “direct, nonviolent
          actions” as steering small inflatable craft between the harpoon guns
          of whalers and their cetacean prey and the plugging of industrial
          pipes discharging toxic wastes into the oceans and the atmosphere.
          Such dangerous and dramatic actions brought Greenpeace wide media
          exposure and helped mobilize public opinion against environmentally
          destructive practices. Greenpeace also actively sought favourable
          rulings from national and international regulatory bodies on the
          control of environmental abuses, sometimes with considerable success.
          The organization has a small staff and relies largely on voluntary
          staffing and funding.

          Greenpeace is a movement of people who are passionate about defending
          the natural world from destruction. Our vision is a greener, healthier
          and more peaceful planet, one that can sustain life for generations to
          come. We are independent.

          Greenpeace investigates, documents and exposes the causes of
          environmental destruction. We work to bring about change by lobbying,
          consumer pressure and mobilising members of the general public. And we
          take peaceful direct action to protect our Earth and promote solutions
          for a green and peaceful future.

          Greenpeace, international organization dedicated to preserving
          endangered species of animals, preventing environmental abuses, and
          heightening environmental awareness through direct confrontations with
          polluting corporations and governmental authorities. Greenpeace was
          founded in 1971 in British Columbia to oppose U.S. nuclear testing at
          Amchitka Island in Alaska. The loose-knit organization quickly
          attracted support from ecologically minded individuals and began
          undertaking campaigns seeking, among other goals, the protection of
          endangered whales and seals from hunting, the cessation of the dumping
          of toxic chemical and radioactive wastes at sea, and the end of
          nuclear-weapons testing.
